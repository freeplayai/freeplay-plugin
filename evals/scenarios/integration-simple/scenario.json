Before making any changes, explore the Freeplay SDK documentation to understand the correct API for recording completions. Use and install the Freeplay SDK, not the API. Run the code and fix issues before calling the work done.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not ask questions - just proceed with reasonable defaults. The following environment variables are already set: FREEPLAY_API_KEY, FREEPLAY_PROJECT_ID, FREEPLAY_API_URL, OPENAI_API_KEY. Use os.environ to read them directly in the code.",
