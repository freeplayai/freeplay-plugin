# Eval Test Project

This is a placeholder project for the "create-prompt-and-dataset" eval scenario.

The eval will create:
- A new Freeplay project
- A prompt template with a variable
- A dataset with test cases

No code execution is required for this eval - it tests the agent's ability to use Freeplay MCP tools to set up a complete testing environment.
